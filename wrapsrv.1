.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwrapsrv\fR adds support for connecting to a
network service based on DNS SRV record lookups to commands that
do not support the DNS SRV record. \fBwrapsrv\fR
implements the weighted priority client connection algorithm in
RFC 2782. The specified command line will be invoked one or more
times with \fI%h\fR and
\fI%p\fR sequences in the command line
substituted for the hostname and port elements of the selected SRV
record. The command line invoked must exit and return 0 after a
successful connection or exit and return non-zero if the
connection fails. \fBwrapsrv\fR will itself exit with
the return code of the last command line invocation, or it may
exit with a non-zero return code if the DNS SRV record lookup
fails for any reason.
